    <textOnly>Dear {!Application__c.Applicant__c},

Unfortunately we have been unable to contact you by phone and I am in the process of chasing your referee, who has not returned the reference request we sent to them.

Please could you contact the referee yourself or supply us with an alternative referee who is able to provide a character reference for you. This can be anyone who has known you for over two years, but is not a family member/partner or lives in the same household as you.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us on 0845 60 30 575 or 01733 37 54 50 or volunteering@rnib.org.uk.

Kind regards
